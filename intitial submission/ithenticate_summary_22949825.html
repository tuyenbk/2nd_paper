                 data ambiguity may lead to a lack of common understanding to the same data between the sender and receiver. While the heterogeneity of data formats has been well addressed thanks to the availability of various international neutral data standards such as LandXML and TransXML; the semantic aspect still has been neglected by the domain researchers. This paper presents a novel methodology to construct an automatically-generated lexicon, namely InfraLex, that formally organizes civil infrastructure technical terms in a lexical hierarchy manner. The lexicon severs as a digital dictionary of domain terms which would enable data integration systems to under- stand the meaning of a data representation, and helps avoid the mismatch of data.

A model for measuring term similarity is trained using the Skip-gram model which uses the corpus as the training dataset. This semantic model is then utilized by a term classi cation algorithm that organizes related terms into separate groups according to their semantic relations.

                 results in high operational costs. Semantic interoperability, which relates to the issue whereby two computer systems may not have the same understanding to the same piece of data, is a radical barrier to computer- to-computer data exchange. Due to the fragmented nature of the infrastructure domain, data representation/terminology varies between phases, stakeholders, or geographic regions 47 (counties, states, etc.). Retrieving the right pieces of data in such a heterogeneous environ- ment becomes increasingly complex (Karimi et al. 2003). Polysemy and synonymy are two major semantic obstacles to the integration and use of a multitude of data sources. Polysemy 2 refers to cases when a unique term has several distinct meanings. For example, the term roadway type can either mean material classi cation or functional classi cation of roadways. In contrast, synonymy is associated with the diversity of terms for the same concept. For in- stance, the longitudinal centerline of a roadway has various terms including `pro le', `crest', `grade-line' and `vertical alignment'. Simply mapping of data names will likely lead to the failure of data extraction, or use of wrong data. Thus, addressing the terminology ambiguity issue becomes crucial to ensure the common understanding on the same dataset between software applications and guarantee the extraction of right data and proper integration of data from multiple sources. An extensive amount of research e ort has been made for the last several decades in stan- dardizing a neutral format for life-cycle data sharing, such as Industry Foundation Classes 61 (IFC) (buildingSMART 2015) and LandXML (landxml.org 2015). However, research to address the issue of terminology inconsistency in the construction industry has been very limited. Filling this gap has been a top aim of the research e orts to realize the seamless exchange of digital data. One of the approaches to enable proper and ambiguity-free reuse of digital data is to develop Model View De nitions (MVDs) (buildingSMART 2016b). MVD formally identi es a mapping matrix between the data entities in a neutral data schema and the domain data labels for a speci c transaction scenario. MVD enables partial models to be easily extracted and unambiguously interpreted. However, this approach

                 takes years to be completed and maintained(Venugopal et al. 2012; Eastman 2012); there is a demand for more rigorous computational techniques that can al- low for automated extraction of data with minimized human intervention. A more robust approach to the issue of data inconsistency is to develop a digital dictionary that explains domain concepts in a machine-readable format. A few construction domain speci c semantic resources have been proposed; for example, the Civil Engineering Thesaurus (CET) (Abuzir 75 and Abuzir 2002), e-Cognos (Wetherill et al. 2002), and buildingSMART data dictionary 76 (ISO 12006-3) (buildingSMART 2016a). These digital knowledge bases allow computer sys- tems to precisely understand meanings of terms. Thus, data mismatch when unifying isolated data sources would be eliminated. They, however, are mainly hand-coded and, therefore, still cover

                 The availability of these NLP tools o ers great potentials for the construction industry where most of the domain knowledge resources are in text documents (e.g., design guidelines, speci cations, etc.). The implementation of NLP will allow for a fast translation of domain knowledge into computer-readable format which is required for a machine-to-machine based data exchange. This paper presents the process of translating text-based domain knowledge into an ex- tensive lexicon, namely InfraLex, for the domain of civil infrastructure. The lexicon formally organizes civil infrastructure technical terms in a lexical hierarchy manner that can serve as the core dictionary in a data integration system. In order to achieve that goal, several Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the C

Rule-based methods, which rely solely on hand-coded rules, are not able to fully cover all complicated sets of human grammatical rules (Marcus 1995); and their performance is, therefore, relatively low. In contrast, the ML-based 5 approach is independent of languages and linguistic grammars (Costa-Jussa et al. 2012) as linguistics patterns can be fast learned from even un-annotated training examples. Thanks to its impressive out-performance, NLP research is shifting to statistical ML-based methods (Cambria and White 2014).

                 performance aspects including accuracy and the degree of compu- tational complexity (Mikolov et al. 2013). The VSM approach has been progressively implemented in the recent NLP related studies in the construction industry. For example, Yalcinkaya and Singh (2015) utilized VSM to extract principle research topics related to BIM from a corpus of nearly 1,000 paper abstracts. In addition, this approach was used for information retrieval to search for text documents (Lv and El-Gohary 2015) or CAD documents (Hsu 2013). The increasingly number of successful use cases in the construction industry has evidently demonstrated that the VSM method can successfully identify the semantic similarity between data labels which is critical to address the issue of semantic interoperability in sharing digital data across the life cycle of an infrastructure project. Lack of an extensive machine-readable dictionary for the civil infrastructure domain Digital dictionaries, which present de nitions of terms in a machine-readable manner, are critical for a machine to perform knowledge works such as interpreting users' intention or understanding human-oriented inputs. However, there is still a shortage of such an ex- tensive dictionary for the civil engineering domain. WordNet (Miller 1995), which is one of the largest lexicons with over 117,000 synsets for NLP related applications, is still generic and not suitable for the highway domain. A few construction domain speci c semantic re- sources have been proposed, for example Civil Engineering Thesaurus (CET) (Abuzir and Abuzir 2002), e-Cognos (Wetherill et al. 2002), and buildingSMART data dictionary (ISO 12006-3) (buildingSMART 2016a). Of these knowledge bases, the buildingSMART dictio- nary is a pioneer semantic database with a long development history of over two decades by the international collaboration of buildingSMART Norway, Construction Speci cations Canada (CSC), U.S. Construction Speci cation Institute (CSI), and STABU Foundation (Hezik 2008). Like other construction speci c digital dictionaries, buildingSMART dictio- nary is mainly hand-coded and time consuming; the vocabulary, therefore, is still relatively limited. Therefore, it is required to develop a handy computational technique that can assist in developing and maintaining these digital dictionaries. Lack of e ective semantic mapping algorithms for handling the data ambiguity issue In the construction industry, research e orts are currently focusing on standardizing the data structure format, there are very few studies that have been done to deal with the issue of sense ambiguity. Zhang and El-Gohary (2015) proposed the ZESeM algorithm to match a certain keyword to the most semantic nearest IFC entity. The algorithm includes two se- quential steps including

                 Since the algorithm accepts matches from the label-based matching step, disambiguation remains in cases where the same word form is used for di erent senses. In addition, ZESeM relies on Wordnet which lacks highway technical terms, NLP-based frameworks built upon this algo- rithm would not have high performance.

                 is a mechanism for integrating or exchange between those BIM models that may use heterogeneous data terminology. IFD assigns each concept a unique identity (ID) and all name variants (synonyms) of a concept will have the same ID. The matching using IDs rather than data names would minimize the occurrence of semantic mismatches. This approach overcomes the limitation regarding name-based match- ing of ZESeM. However, both of them assume the full vocabulary coverage of the existing domain knowledge bases. As discussed above, the domain dictionaries are currently far be- low the required scope of vocabularies and achieving the desired size is challenging. Thus, a novel method that can allow for ambiguity-free data exchange without relying on hand-coded resources is needed . INFRALEX CONSTRUCTION Overview

                 model uses the unlabeled highway corpora as the training dataset. This training process transforms the identi ed terms into representation vectors in a coordinate space model named H-VSM. Using this term vector space, the similarity degree between technical terms can be determined; and based on that the list of nearest terms for a given term can be obtained. The second module designs an algorithm for identifying the relation (e.g., synonymy, hypernymy, hyponymy, or attribute) between each item in the nearest list and the target term. The InfraLex lexicon is nally constructed by organizing the domain vocabulary into a network of terms which link to each other through the identi ed semantic relations. Speci cally, the procedure followed to compile the InfraLex dictionary is comprised of the following steps: (a) collect highway technical documents to compose a domain corpus; (b) extract the multi-word terms from the highway corpus; (c) prepare the training dataset 9 for training the H-VSM model; (d) select appropriate values for the training parameters and perform the training of the H-VSM model; and (e) design an algorithm to classify related terms into groups of lexical relations. The below sections discuss these steps in detail. Data collection As mentioned earlier, H-VSM was trained using a machine learning model which requires a text corpus as the source of the training dataset. The input text corpus was built upon a plethora of highway engineering manuals from the Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) and from 22 State DOTs. The technical terms in a guidance document in the engi- neering eld are organized in various formats such as plain text, tables, and equations. Since tables and equations are not yet supported by the state-of-the-art NLP techniques, they were removed from the text corpus. The nal outcome of this phase is a plain text corpus consisting of 16 million words. This dataset is utilized to extract highway related technical terms which are then trained and converted into representation vectors. Multi-word terms extraction A technical term can be a single word (e.g., roadway, lane, etc.) or be composed of multiple words (e.g., right of way, at grade intersection, etc.). The meaning of multi-word terms may not be directly interpreted from the meanings of their single words. In order for the Skip-gram model to learn the semantics of multi-word terms, every occurrence of multi-word terms in the corpus needs to be detected and replaced with connected blocks of word members so that they can be treated as single words.

                 also utilized for this task. 266 iii Noun phrase detection: Linguists argue that a technical term is either a noun (e.g., 267 road) or a noun phrase (NP) (e.g., right of way) that frequently occurs in domain text documents (Justeson and Katz 1995). Thus, NPs are good multi-word term candidates. Table 1 presents the proposed extraction patterns which are modi ed from the lters suggested by Justeson and Katz (1995) to extract NPs. In addition, in order to avoid the di erentiation between syntactic variants of the same term, for example `roadway' and `roadways', term variants need to be normalized. The following are two types of syntactic variants and the proposed normalization methods. • Type 1 - Plural forms, for example `roadways' and `roadway'. The Porter stem- ming algorithm (Porter 1980), which can allow for automated removal of su xes, is applied on the corpus before extracting NPs. • Type 2 - Preposition noun phrases, for example `roadway type' and `type of roadway'. In order to normalize this type of variant, the form with preposition is converted into the non-preposition form by removing the preposition and reversing the order of the remaining portions. For instance, `type of roadway' will become `roadway type'. iv Multi-word term candidate ranking and selection: Multi-word term de nition varies between authors, and there is a lack of formal and widely accepted rules to de ne if a NP is a multi-word term (Frantzi et al. 2000).

                 term extraction process above results in a dataset containing the detected terms along with their termhood scores. These terms are ordered by C-value, and the ones that have negative C-values are discarded. To remove non-terms from the term candidate list, a manual evaluation process is con- ducted. Table 2 illustrates the evaluation results for several excerpts of the extracted candi- dates. Since a longer candidate list requires more evaluation e ort, NPs with low occurrence frequencies that are unlikely to be technical terms should be automatically eliminated before 12 the manual evaluation. With the frequency threshold of 2, the list consists of 112,024 terms. The list size drops to 8,922 when a threshold of 50 is used. Manual review of such a long list is still a challenging task. To minimize both laborious work and the number of true terms wrongly discarded, the list was evaluated at several ranges of C-values. The precision values, which represent the percentage of real terms in these groups, are presented in Figure 3. As shown in the gure, precision values are relatively low for groups with c-values less than 70. To balance between human e ort and precision of the nal term list, this research applied a manual review on all of the automatically extracted terms below the c-value threshold of 70. Training dataset preparation This step aims at processing the collected text corpus and collecting the training data for developing the H-VSM model.

Each occurrence of a word will correspondingly generate a data point in the training dataset. Before collecting the training dataset, an additional step is needed to handle the issue related to multi-word terms. Since document scanning is on a word-by-word basis, the corpus must be adjusted so that multi-word terms can be treated like single words. To ful ll that requirement,

                 model includes three major parameters that are frequency threshold, hidden layer size and window size (see Table 3). To eliminate those data points with low frequencies of occurrence that are unlikely to be technical terms, Word2vec allows for the use of frequency threshold. Any word with the rate lower than the limit will be ignored. Radim (2014) suggests a range of (0-100) depending on the data set size. Setting this parameter high will enhance the accuracy, but many true technical terms would be out of vocabulary. A preliminary study based on the preliminary corpus with only several millions of words shows that with the frequency of 20, there are very few non-technical terms involved in the training dataset. Hence, with the larger dataset to be collected, this parameter can be higher and up to around 50. The second important parameter is layer size which determines the number of nodes in the hidden layer. This parameter highly a ects the training accuracy and processing time. A larger layer size is better in terms of accuracy, but this will be paid o by the running time. The reasonable values for this parameter are from ten to hundreds (Radim 2014). The nal major parameter, context window size, decides how many context words to be 14 considered. Google recommends the size of 10 for the Skip-gram model (Google Inc. 2016). These parameters are subject to be changed so that the best model can be achieved. The e ects of these parameters on the model performance are discussed in Section 4. Figure 5 presents the term space model of H-VSM derived from the training process when the parameters are set 50, 300 and 10 respectively. H-VSM currently consists of more than 6,000 technical terms.

Figure 5 illustrates the clustering of terms by their distances. In this gure, an inlet can be inferred to be more similar to an outlet (blue) than a sidewalk (green). Using this technique, the most similar terms for a given term can be obtained. Table 4 shows a partial ranked list of the nearest terms of `roadway' in order of similarity score.

A lexicon, also known as a lightweight knowledge base, typically includes terms and relations. The core relations of a lexicon are synonym (meaning equivalence), hypernym- hyponym (also known as IS-A or parent-child relation), attribute (concept property), and association (e.g. part-of) (Jiang and Conrath 1997; Lee et al. 2013). Two terms that relate each other through these semantic relations would have a high similarity score. Therefore, the top nearest terms resulted from H-VSM would be a great starting point for detecting relations between technical terms. Table 4 illustrates a list of nearest terms of `roadway'. In this list, the true synonyms are `highway' (1), `traveled-way' (2) and `road' (4); the attributes include `roadway-section' (3), `roadway-shoulder' (12); and `adjacent-roadway' (7) and `undivided' (37) are hyponyms which show di erent types of roadway. The speci c objective of this task is to detect the semantic relations among terms which are used for rearranging the nearest terms obtained from the H-VSM model. Algorithm

The algorithm utilizes linguistic rules and clustering analysis to organize the nearest list into the following three groups: (1) attribute, (2) hyponym, and (3) synonym/sibling. The algorithm, rst detects terms belonging to the rst two categories using linguistic patterns. The lter rules to detect these relations are presented in Table 5. For a multi-word term matching pattern 1, we can infer that Noun1 is an attribute of concept Noun2 ; and Noun2 is an attribute of Noun1 in the pattern 2. Pattern 3 is for detecting hyponyms where the matched NP is a hyponym of Noun2 concept. The remained nearest words will fall into the third group. However, some of them have far or even no relation with the target word. In order to address this issue, this research employed the K-mean clustering algorithm (MacQueen 1967) to split the remained list into three distinct layers

For example, the developed InfraLex lexicon can eliminate the mismatch of data labels when integrating data from various states to develop a national database (e.g., unit cost, produc- tivity, road condition, etc.). Also, questionnaire designers can utilize InfraLex to search for synonyms so that appropriate terms can be selected for speci c groups of potential respon- dents who might be from multiple disciplines or regions. Furthermore, the query systems for extracting data from digital models would be able to nd alternative ways to query data when users' keywords do not match any entity in the database.

                 retrieval systems can also use the semantic relations provided by InfraLex to extract relevant project documents by analyzing the the relatedness between the user's input and the keywords in the documents. By allowing computer systems to understand technical terms which are a basic unit of human language, this study is also expected to fundamentally transform the way human interacts with machine. The current study has some limitations that may contribute the low overall performance. First, the highway corpus is still relatively small with only 16 million words, compared to the corpus sizes in other domains with billions of words. Since the recall value largely depends on the corpus size, the expansion of the highway corpus would enable more technical terms to be covered in InfraLex. Future research is needed to enhance the performance of InfraLex by enlarging the data training set in both size and the number of disciplines involved through- out the life cycle of a highway project, such as asset management, project programming, construction management. The corpus also needs to cover other types of transportation as- sets like bridge, tunnel, railway, culvert, etc. Another work that can potentially improve the model performance is to distinguish synonym and sibling which are still in the same group in the InfraLex system. When these two lexical relations are separated, the possibility of recognizing a wrong synonym will be reduced; and consequently, the precision value would be enhanced. CONCLUSIONS Data manipulation from multiple sources is a challenging task in infrastructure manage- ment due to the inconsistency of data format and terminology. The contribution of this study is a digital lexicon of highway related technical terms (named InfraLex) which can en- able a computer to understand semantic meanings of terms. This research employs advanced 19 NLP techniques to extract technical terms from a highway text corpus which is composed of 16 million words built on a collection of design manuals from 22 State DOTs across the U.S. Machine learning was used to train the semantic similarity between technical terms. An algorithm was designed to classify the nearest terms resulted from the semantic similar- ity model into distinct groups according to their lexical relationships. This algorithm was employed to develop the InfraLex database. The developed lexicon has been evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the computational model and a man-crafted gold standard. The result shows an accuracy of over 80 percent. The best model is associated with the training parameters of 50, 100 and 10 respectively for frequency threshold, hidden layer size, and window size. Although signi cant improvement is shown in comparison with the existing thesaurus databases, the overall performance is not relatively high. This might be

                 Future research will be conducted to expand the highway corpus to further disciplines such as asset management, and transportation operation. The research opens a new gate for computational tools regarding natural language pro- cessing in the highway sector. InfraLex would enable computer systems to understand terms and consequently enable the extraction of value information from project documents and transform the way human interacts with computer by allowing users to use natural lan- guage.
